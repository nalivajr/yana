# Yana
Yet Another iNteraction Assembly

Yana is an android library, which allows different applications to interact with one another by sending messages via database rather than broadcast.

Of course, this library is not going to replace one of the basic component of all android applications, but may be helpfull in some cases.

More details will be provided as soon as initial iterations will be finished.
(see develop branch for updates)
